The short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767:

 Int
The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647. In general, and in our tutorial, the int data type is the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.

Long
The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L":

 Float
The float data type can store fractional numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038. Note that you should end the value with an "f":

 Double
The double data type can store fractional numbers from 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+308. Note that you should end the value with a "d":
